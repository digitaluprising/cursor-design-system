# Description Length Guidelines

## Character Limit

All descriptions must be **130 characters or less** - approximately the length of:
"Cursor is a fork of VSCode, so you can use all your favorite extensions and keybindings. It's the editor you"

## What This Applies To

- **Component descriptions** in JSDoc comments
- **Prop descriptions** in TypeScript interfaces
- **Alt text** for images
- **Button text** and UI labels
- **Tooltips** and help text
- **Error messages** and validation text
- **Meta descriptions** and SEO content

## Examples

```tsx
// ✅ Good - concise and clear (under 130 chars)
interface ButtonProps {
  /** Primary action button with hover effects */
  children: React.ReactNode;
  /** Button style variant */
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

// ✅ Good - JSDoc comment (under 130 chars)
/**
 * Button component with Apple-level design precision
 * Features refined interactions and micro-animations
 */

// ✅ Good - alt text (under 130 chars)
<ImageWrapper
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Developer using Cursor AI code editor on laptop"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

// ❌ Too long - exceeds 130 characters
interface ButtonProps {
  /** This is a primary action button component that includes sophisticated hover effects and micro-animations for enhanced user experience */
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Writing Tips

- Be concise and direct
- Focus on the essential information
- Use active voice
- Avoid unnecessary words
- Test your descriptions by counting characters
